      <h1>Why We Exist</h1>
    </header>

    <p>COVID-19 has changed our lives in ways that were not imaginable a year ago. Nearly 150 million children studying in government schools have been forced to abruptly transition to online learning during the lockdown. India ranks 72 out of 73 countries in terms of students' math, science and reading abilities. The lockdown has only made this worse as online learning is not tailored to serve these students. We began Plio with the sole mission of using technology to improve learning outcomes for government-school children through (<code>P</code>) Personalized Learning (<code>L</code>) with Interactive (<code>I</code>) and Open (<code>O</code>) content.</p>
<p>In this post, we primarily aim to explain how online learning, in its current state, fails to address the majority of students and provide a glimpse of how we aim to nudge it in the right direction.</p>
<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>
<h2 id="discovering-high-quality-local-language-content">Discovering high-quality local language content</h2>
<p>Most of these students learn in their local language while most of the content online is in English. During the lockdown, some non-profits like TicTacLearn, Avanti Sankalp and BodhaGuru have started to create high-quality Hindi language content receiving more than 10 million monthly views. However, even though high-quality local language content is available, it is hard to discover them on platforms like YouTube as their algorithms are not optimized for learning.</p>
<h2 id="passive-learning">Passive learning</h2>
<p>These children also have short attention spans. Avanti Sankalp&rsquo;s YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcWbm9eHkD-Mj_HdCK1_4Ww?view_as=subscriber">channel</a> has more than 60,000 subscribers and more than a million monthly views. Even on the best performing video, which is just 3-minute long, the average watch-time is less than 90 seconds.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post-images/retention.png" alt="Retention"></p>
<h2 id="need-for-remediation">Need for Remediation</h2>
<p>Most of these students are also below grade-level: they might be enrolled in class 8 but still won&rsquo;t be able to answer questions at the level of class 4. Every student has their own learning preference: some might like whiteboard-aided material while others might learn best through visual animations. Thus, providing the same homogeneous content to all the students does not work. The learning process needs to be tailored to their learning levels and preferences.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-adequate-feedback-for-teachers">Lack of adequate feedback for teachers</h2>
<p>The lockdown has also made it hard for teachers to engage with students. WhatsApp has emerged as the major source of communication during this period. Daily lesson plans in the form of YouTube videos are being sent over thousands of teacher-managed WhatsApp groups. In schools, teachers constantly received visual feedback on how the students are engaging with the material being taught. However, now, the teacher has no way of knowing if the student is even watching the video. Since they do not receive any feedback about how the students are interacting with the learning material beyond their performance on weekly quizzes, they are unable to get regular actionable feedback specific to each learner.</p>
<h1 id="a-new-way-of-learning">A new way of learning</h1>
<p>We have established by now that these students need a new way of learning and research has shown that interactivity and personalization helps improve learning outcomes, especially for those at the lowest rung of the ladder. Plio aims to alter how we approach learning by keeping the learner truly at the center, by optimizing for her needs and preferences. Think of us as trying to build the YouTube for Education - with the recommendations being optimized for high-quality local language content personalized to the needs and preferences of each learner. Instead of recommending passive videos, we will recommend active learning elements which we call, wait for it, a <code>plio</code>! A simple example of a <code>plio</code> is a video with questions overlaid at specific timestamps.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post-images/screenshot.png" alt="Plio Screenshot"></p>
<p>Our aim is to democratize learning tools to bring the benefits of research-backed technology to those at the Bottom of the Pyramid and empower teachers to truly understand their students. We will make the data generated through Plio available to researchers to advance the understanding of how students are learning digitally and how it can be improved. Our initial pilots have already shown a more than 50% improvement in audience retention when compared to YouTube.</p>
<p>Today, any teacher can use our <a href="http://creator.plio.in">Creator platform</a> to overlay questions at specific timestamps on top of any YouTube video and our <a href="http://dashboard.plio.in">Dashboard</a> provides rich analytics about the student&rsquo;s interaction with the video and the questions.</p>
<h1 id="what-next">What next?</h1>
<p>The goal of this blog is to share our learnings as we build our tech and also, to bring real stories of the students we aim to serve. We are excited to have you on this journey with us and we believe that we have the potential to truly improve the lives of the millions of students who are the future of our country.</p>
