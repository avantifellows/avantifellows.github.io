      <description>COVID-19 has changed our lives in ways that were not imaginable a year ago. Nearly 150 million children studying in government schools have been forced to abruptly transition to online learning during the lockdown. India ranks 72 out of 73 countries in terms of students&#39; math, science and reading abilities. The lockdown has only made this worse as online learning is not tailored to serve these students. We began Plio with the sole mission of using technology to improve learning outcomes for government-school children through (P) Personalized Learning (L) with Interactive (I) and Open (O) content.</description>
